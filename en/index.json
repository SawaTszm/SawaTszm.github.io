Killer is provided to avoid the worst-case scenario where the system itself stops due to inability to allocate free memory.\n(translated)\n日経XTECH\nIt seems that the forced kill of the process is the result of OOM Killer\u0026rsquo;s work to prevent the system itself from stopping.\nIn other words, the cause this time was lack of memory.\nIn Docker for mac, I looked at Preferences \u0026gt; Resources \u0026gt; Memory and found that I currently have 3.75GB allocated, and Swap is 1GB.\nIn addition, I checked the memory used by docker in the Mac\u0026rsquo;s Activity Monitor, and found that it was using up almost all of the allocated memory.\nWhat I tried I went to Preferences \u0026gt; Resources \u0026gt; Memory in Docker for mac and increased the allocated memory as much as I could.\nThe mac itself is 16GB, so I decided to take a look at it and increase it to 5GB.\nOnce again, I ran composer require league/flysystem-aws-s3-v3 ~1.0.\nroot@9f833b0a116f:/var/www/html/laravel# composer require league/flysystem-aws-s3-v3 Using version ^1.0 for league/flysystem-aws-s3-v3 ~~~ Package manifest generated successfully. 38 packages you are using are looking for funding.
